# LiveSplit-ASL
Collective repo for all my LiveSplit autosplitters.

## Myst III: Exile

- Contains splits for linking to another age, and for triggering ending. Can be indidivually disabled in settings.

## Myst IV: Revelation
- Starts timer upon loading intro cinematic. Set start timer to -5.2 seconds!
- Contains splits for all age transitions (only those we need for the speedrun), for stepping away from sound panel after Atrus leaves, for stepping away from the third (big) conductor box on the faraway island in Spire, when reaching the old memory chamber's bathysphere, when losing control to the Dream stone in the old memory chamber, and when loading the last node that triggers the ending. All splits can be disabled in settings.
